# CEO Exits

## Project Overview

2019 had a record number of CEOs who stepped down from their companies. We built a Flask app to present the # of CEO exits from the past 5 years, 2015-2019.

The Government/Non-Profit sector lead all sectors in CEO exits with 218 by August. According Challenger, the Technology sector announced the second-highest number of CEO changes in August 2019 with 134, up 34% from the 99 who left their posts through August 2018.

We will be looking at stock performance of AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, IBM, and INTC.

## App Instructions

To run this app, navigate to your project root folder and run either of the following shell commands:
